Inspired from the movie Tron, our game is uses spaceships trying to mark their territory in space. The goal of the game is to make the opponents drive into the borders of the screen or drive through the trail of one's spaceship. It is a multiplayer game with 2 players playing it in the same computer and the last ship alive becomes the winner. We also have a collision effect so when two ships collide into each other, their shields make them switch their paths with each other and momentarily gain speed (like a boost). This was our attempt to learn and program a web-based offline game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
